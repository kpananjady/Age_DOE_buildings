# Age_DOE_buildings

In the file Merges and Wrangling.ipynb, I get all my data ready so I can access the year built for 95 percent of the school buildings in my rated dataset. 

In Age Analysis.ipynb, I explore the relationship between building age and accessibility rating mathematically. In the QJIS files, I map out the patterns I see, the results of which you can see in the screenshots.
